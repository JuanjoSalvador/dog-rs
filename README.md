# dog-rs

Dog command for *nix systems, Rust port of [dog](https://github.com/JuanjoSalvador/dog).
Because there is a `cat` command, should be a `dog` command too.
It was written completely using VS Code and Debian, compiled with cargo and developed in a morning.

> This package is purely a joke, please do not take it seriously.
